# Design Choices

## Fonts
I have used [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/ "Google Fonts") to find a text that best suits the feel of the website.
I have used? for most of the site.

## Icons
I have chosen to use the amazing icons supplied from [Font Awesome library](https://fontawesome.com/ "Font Awesome"). These icons are easy to interpret and are free to use on the website

## Colours

I used [Coolors](https://coolors.co/ "Coolors") to generate the colour palette.
All variable colours were chosen with the point to be able to quickly be able to make changes as needed.
Any other general RGB colours in the CSS are to stay as is and only the variable are planned to be changed if need be.

All variable colours are as follows:

  ### General colours used

  * --white: rgb(255, 255, 255);
  * --light-gray: rgb(206, 212, 218);
  * --sonic-silver: rgb(108, 117, 125);

    ![General colours](assets/images/general%20colours.png)



  ### Dark theme colours

  * --davys-grey: rgb(74, 80, 87);
  * --onyx: rgb(52, 58, 64);
  * --charleston-green: rgb(34, 38, 42);

  ![Dark theme colours](assets/images/dark%20theme.png)

  ### Default (light) theme

  * --pacific-blue: rgb(84, 176, 189);
  * --alice-blue: rgb(240, 248, 255);
  * --turquoise: rgb(102, 222, 208);
  * --sky-blue-crayola: rgb(107, 219, 233);
  * --maya-blue: rgb(132, 197, 254);

# Testing

+ During testing the biggest issue is the duplication of the questions on the pub quiz mode and sometimes during the hard mode.
+ Found that on mobile devices, it sometimes would render differently on iPhone Safari browsers. Could not figure out the reason for it but as it was intermittent I decided to leave the code as-is.
+ On some devices, the Theme toggler is not being checked on load. After loading it once it would be fine but seemed to be only on Dark themed devices that this issue happened.
+ Some mobile devices the screen width would cause the rules box to overstretch. I tried adding more media queries however this would cause many of the devices to have layout errors. I decided to revert it back to have the majority working.
+ Using the browser's responsive device list would not simulate the actual device layout. I had to use the actual device to achieve the desired result.

## Unfixed Bugs

+ Found that on mobile devices, it sometimes would render differently on iPhone Safari browsers. Could not figure out the reason for it but as it was intermittent I decided to leave the code as-is.
+ On smaller devices, the user could not change the theme when viewing the rules section after selecting the game mode. Looking at options to achieve this but will be for future releases.
\
&nbsp;
