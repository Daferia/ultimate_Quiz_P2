# Design Choices

## Fonts
I have used [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/ "Google Fonts") to find a text that best suits the feel of the website.
I have used ? for most of the site.

## Icons
I have chosen to use the amazing icons supplied from [Font Awesome library](https://fontawesome.com/ "Font Awesome"). These icons are easy to interpret and are free to use on the website

## Colours

I have used [Coolors](https://coolors.co/ "coolors") to generate a suitable palette for my colour scheme.

 I will explain the uses of the various colours below:

# Testing

+ During tsting the biggest issue is the duplication of the questions on the pubquiz mode and sometimes during the hard mode.
+ Found that on mobile devices, it sometimes would render differently on Iphone Safari browsers. Could not figure out the reason around it but as it was intermintent i decided to leave the code as is. Left the css in for safari browsers but will need to relook at it later.
